Problem Statement
-----------------

Design a URL shortener that generates a shortened URL for the requested actual URL.
The request could come from registered users or could be anonymous.
The system should fulfill the following line items.

Stores
------

#. Registered user's details, they are:
        #. user_id
        #. username
        #. name
        #. list of shortened URLs

#. Shortened URL's details, they are:
        #. Actual URL
        #. Shortened URL
        #. Creation time
        #. TTL (Time to live)

Features
--------

* The system should be able to generate and save a shortened URL for the requested
actual URL. The request can be anonymous (coming from the non-registered user) or
can come from the registered users.

* The system should be able to retrieve the actual URL for a given shortened URL
regardless of who is requesting (non-registered can fetch actual URL generated by the
registered user using its shortened URL and vice versa).

* The system should be able to handle collision during URL generation covering the
following cases: (see an example for better explanation)
        * NO two requesting URLs can have the same shortened URL, Globally.
        * Generate and save different shortened URLs for the same requested actual URL
        if it is requested more than once, regardless of whether it is requested by the
        same person or a different person or even anonymous.

* The system should provide flexibility to registered users to add TTL to the requested
URL or to keep it forever. Whereas, for an anonymous user it should always put some
system defined TTL. You are free to use any number here.

* The system should be able to remove expired shortened/actual URLs from the system.
You are free to use any strategy to do it.
